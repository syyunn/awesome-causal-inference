This can be classified as two different approach: covariate-based method vs. latent-method (See Pearl 2015 "Detecting Latent Heterogeneity" for more details)


### Decision Trees

#### Random Forest (Causal Forest)
- Estimation and Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Random Forests (Wager and Athey, 2017)

#### Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART)
- BART: BAYESIAN ADDITIVE REGRESSION TREES (Chipman et al., 2010)

### Domain Adaptation (a.k.a Covariate Shift)

- Learning Representations for Counterfactual Inference (Johansson, 2016 ICLR)


# Reinforcement Learning

### Bandit Feedback (a.k.a Contextual Bandit)

- Contextual Bandits typically select action $t$ based on the context $x$ - thisis related to the treatment assignment problem in causal inference, which is denoted as $P(t|x)$.


### Off-Policy Evaluation 
- Doubly Robust Policy Evaluation and Learning (Dudik et al. 2011 ICML)
